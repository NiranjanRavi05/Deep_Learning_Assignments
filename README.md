# Deep Learning Assignments

## Simple Regression
In this exercise I gained insights about basic mathematical background for a simple regression task and covered it's practical implementation in Tensorflow 2. I also explored the phenomenon of overfitting and derived different regularizations from a probabilistic perspective. This exercise covers a very simple task with a very basic neural architecture.

## Age Regression
In this exercise I have applied the concept of regression to the problem of estimating the age of a person from his or her potrait. I used Keras in order to build our model from predefined layers. I used **CNN architecture** here to analyse and predict the age.

## Classification
In this exercise I learned how to use Keras in order to quickly develop neural networks and train them on different data sets. I worked on the concepts of **Trasfer learning** and **catastrophic forgetting**. For this we utilized the MobileNetV2 architecture that was trained on the ImageNet data set and fine tuned it on the Caltech 101 data set.

## GAN
In this exercise I created a miniature DC-GAN framework for the generation of MNIST dataset.
